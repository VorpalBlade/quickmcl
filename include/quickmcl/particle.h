//! +-----+---------+----+----
//! | p1  | p2      | p3 | ...
//! +-----+---------+----+----
//! </pre>
//!
//! This class implements indexing into that collection, based on the the total
//! "weight so far". It is used as a helper to resampling.
//!
//! Note that the intervals of the weights are semi-open intervals: [a,b).
//! Example: p1 has weight 0.2, it will be returned for lookups in the range
//! [0,0.2).
