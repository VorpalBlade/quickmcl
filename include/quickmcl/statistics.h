//! An interesting property is that we can combine multiple instances with
//! simple additions of the members as long as finalise() hasn't been called.
//! This allows easily calculating per cluster statistics, then combining all
//! the clusters to compute per-filter statistics. It would also allow a
//! map-reduce kind of implementation if you want to multi-thread it (shouldn't
//! really be needed).
